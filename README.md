# simple-slidev-sample

## Introduction

Sample slides created by [Gregory M.
Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/) to illustrate the use of
Slidev's features. These slides were created from other slides, that I used for
teaching, that were created with LaTeX and Beamer.

## Commands

To start the slide show:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- visit http://localhost:3030

## Steps

You can edit the [slides.md](./slides.md) to see the changes. You can learn more
about Slidev on [documentations](https://sli.dev/).
