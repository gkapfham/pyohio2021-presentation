# PyOhio 2021 Presentation

## Introduction

Sample slides created by [Gregory M.
Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/) to illustrate the use of
Slidev's features. These slides were created from other slides, that I used for
teaching, that were created with LaTeX and Beamer.

## Commands

To start the slide show:

- Type `npm install` in the project directory
- Type `npm run dev` to start a local development server
- Visit http://localhost:3030 to view the slides

## Steps

You can edit the [slides.md](./slides.md) to see the changes. You can learn more
about Slidev on [documentations](https://sli.dev/).
