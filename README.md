# PyOhio 2021 Presentation

## Introduction

Sample slides created by [Gregory M.
Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/) to illustrate the use of
Slidev's features. These slides were created from other slides, that I used for
teaching, that were created with LaTeX and Beamer.

please follow these
[instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)
